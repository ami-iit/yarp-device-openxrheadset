# build tree>/bin and libraries/archives in <top level of the build tree>/lib.
# This is particularly useful to run ctests on libraries built on Windows
# machines: tests, which are executables, are placed in the same folders of
# dlls, which are treated as executables as well, so that they can properly
# find the libraries to run. This is a because of missing RPATH on Windows.

# Build position independent code.
# Position Independent Code (PIC) is commonly used for shared libraries so that
# the same shared library code can be loaded in each program address space in a
# location where it will not overlap with any other uses of such memory.
# In particular, this option avoids problems occurring when a process wants to
# load more than one shared library at the same virtual address.
# Since shared libraries cannot predict where other shared libraries could be
# loaded, this is an unavoidable problem with the traditional shared library
# concept.
# Generating position-independent code is often the default behavior for most
# modern compilers.
# Moreover linking a static library that is not built with PIC from a shared
# library will fail on some compiler/architecture combinations.
# Further details on PIC can be found here:
# https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/11/03/position-independent-code-pic-in-shared-libraries/

# extensions off.
